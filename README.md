## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows 10/11** (required for full functionality)
- **Python 3.10+**
- **Administrator privileges** (recommended for full system control)

### Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the repository
cd Windows-mcp

# Install the package and dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Install System Dependencies

Some features require additional system tools:

1. **Tesseract OCR** (optional, for OCR features):
   - Download from: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
   - Add to PATH

### Step 3: Configure with Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-control": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "-m",
        "windows_mcp.server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Or if you installed it as a package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "windows-control": {
      "command": "windows-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop

After adding the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to load the MCP server.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Automation Example

```
User: "Take a screenshot of my screen and save it to Desktop"

AI: [Uses screenshot tool with save_path parameter]

User: "Open Notepad and type 'Hello World'"

AI: [Uses launch_application to open notepad.exe, then keyboard_type to type the text]

User: "Click the Start button and then type 'calculator'"

AI: [Uses mouse_click at Start button coordinates, then keyboard_type to search]
```

### Advanced Automation Example

```
User: "List all Chrome windows, activate the first one, then take a screenshot"

AI: [Uses list_windows to find Chrome windows, activate_window to bring it to front,
     then screenshot to capture the screen]

User: "Show me system information and kill any processes using more than 50% CPU"

AI: [Uses get_system_info to show system status, list_processes to find high CPU
     processes, then kill_process to terminate them]
```

### System Control Example

```
User: "Lock my screen"

AI: [Uses lock_screen tool]

User: "Restart my computer in 60 seconds"

AI: [Uses restart tool with delay parameter set to 60]
```

1. **PyAutoGUI Failsafe**: Move mouse to top-left corner to abort automation
2. **Confirmation for Destructive Actions**: System control actions should be confirmed
3. **Error Handling**: All tools include comprehensive error handling
4. **Process Protection**: Prevents accidental system process termination

## Security Considerations

This MCP server provides powerful system control capabilities. Consider the following:

1. **Run with appropriate permissions**: Don't run as administrator unless necessary
2. **Review automation requests**: Understand what the AI will do before confirming
3. **Use in trusted environments**: Only use with trusted AI assistants
4. **Monitor system changes**: Keep track of automated actions
5. **Backup important data**: Before using system control features

## Troubleshooting

### "Windows API not available" Error
- Install pywin32: `pip install pywin32`
- Run post-install script: `python Scripts/pywin32_postinstall.py -install`

### Screenshot Not Working
- Check if mss is installed: `pip install mss`
- Verify screen permissions on Windows 11

### Mouse/Keyboard Control Not Working
- Install PyAutoGUI: `pip install pyautogui`
- Disable "Enhanced Pointer Precision" in Windows mouse settings for better accuracy

### Permission Errors
- Run Claude Desktop as administrator (only if necessary)
- Check Windows UAC settings

## Development

### Project Structure
```
Windows-mcp/
â”œâ”€â”€ windows_mcp/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.py          # Main MCP server implementation

### Adding New Tools

1. Add tool definition in `list_tools()`
2. Add handler in `call_tool()`
3. Implement tool function following the pattern
4. Test thoroughly before deployment

### Testing

```bash
# Test the server directly
python -m windows_mcp.server

# Test with MCP inspector (if available)
mcp-inspector windows-mcp
```
